        Lyrics
    </h2>
    <pre>
            Came in for the embers
            Stayed out for the breeze
            I need to feel elements to remind me
            There's beauty when it's bleak

            Stuck out long before lights down
            Why do I breathe?

            Oh, I know
            The more that I love the less that I feel
            The times that I jumped never were real
            They say that all scars will heal but I know
            Maybe I won't

            But the waves won't break my boat
            But the waves won't break my boat

            Stones crash on the boardwalk
            Wind rushed through the trees
            I keep my eyes peeled
            The memories always fall short
            Of what we could have been

            Left out long before last call
            What do I need?

            Oh, I know
            The more that I love the less that I feel
            The times that I jumped never were real
            They say that all scars will heal but I know
            Maybe I won't

            But the waves won't break my boat
            But the waves won't break my boat
            But the waves won't break my boat
            The waves won't break my boat

            The more that I love the less that I feel
            The times that I jumped never were real
            They say that all scars will heal but I know
            Maybe I won't

    And the waves won't break my boat
